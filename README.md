# ngMadLibs

A simple Mad Libs app built on Angular

If you're not familiar with "Mad Lib" it's the name of a word game that dates back to the 1960s and is still around. It's the sort of game kids will play to stay occupied while riding in the back of a car with an equally bored sibling on a cross-country family vacation. You are prompted to supply keywords of your choosing: for instance, a proper name, an adjective, a sport, a dessert item. After making your choices, you plug each into a preset, paragraph-long text that has blanks that you fill in with the word choices you've made.
